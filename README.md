# .NET 8 Identity Cookie based

### What's this?

Everyone knows, if you start a new project you've to implement core things like: Authentication, Authorization, User management, Roles management, Logging, Errorhandling etc...

I was tired of doing so and created this boilerplate. I was inspired by this Article [ASP.NET Core: From Beginner to advanced](https://burakneis.com/asp-net-core-identity/)
