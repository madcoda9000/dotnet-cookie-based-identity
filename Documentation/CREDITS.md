## NOTE

You've to respect the license of the projects I've listetd here! That's why i listed the projects here with the corosponding link.  
As i am writing this documentation they provide a free (for commercial too) License! **Anyway, they can change their license. So, before using this in an commercial project, do yourself a favour and visit their page to verify that they provide a free license that is suitable for commercial use!**
